 c++ learning and playing

Learnt that writing super useful python files is great until you use it to split up a 2.6GB video (worked!) but then github can't deal with the syncing and keeps crashing ur computer so you have to abandon the repo and do c++ in it's own repo like you should have done from the beggining.

Noice
